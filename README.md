# KataCoda Scenarios.

## Description.

Katacoda is an interactive learning and training platform for software 
developers. Each student is given access to a new environment without the need 
to install all the required component by themselves. 

Katacoda also provides isolation for each student, so they can explore and push 
the limits of their learning skills without worry about breaking the environment 
for fellow students.
